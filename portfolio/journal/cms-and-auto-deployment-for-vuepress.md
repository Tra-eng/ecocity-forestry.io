# Young entrepreneurs in "the plastic box"

Let's check out how we can manage the content from within Forestry and automatically deploy our VuePress site.

## Lets get them out!

This theme is pre-configured and works out of the box with Forestry. Create an account at [Forestry](https://forestry.io "Forestry") and import your repository. You can now edit, manage and preview your content.

That's it, that's all. Enjoy your new site!

## Removal of obstacles

1. Mentor / Mentee relationships around 
2. Green infrastructure investment becomes opportunity
3. Cultural momentum
